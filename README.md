## The idea

_This is a personal project with no intentions on using on anything besides learning React / Redux and other useful things. Everything is expected to change_ **a lot**.

The idea behind this project is to be able to create lists of guests who can enter your party, and each of them will be able to bring friends. So you'll know the total amount of people coming to your party.

For future parties, you can use the same guests, and (on the future) you'll be able to generate statistics.

## Technology used

* React
* React Router
* Redux
* Redux Loop
* React Redux Firebase
* Bootstrap (only for minor style, using CSS Grid)
